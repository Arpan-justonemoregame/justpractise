This contract is a fun little demo that shows you how to "roll a dice" in a smart contract. This is useful in many gaming applications, but the purpose is to show you how to implement VRF in a smart contract.

Writing a VRF consumer smart contract
Let's write a smart contract that gets a random number, uses that to mimic rolling a 4 sided die, and then assigns the roll to a Hogwarts House for the roller.

Open Remix and create a new workspace called "VRF", create a folder called contracts and a file called HousePicker.sol inside this folder. In this file, paste the code from the HousePicker.sol file in the course code repo.
